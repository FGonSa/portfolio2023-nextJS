The game involves reaching the finish line by avoiding obstacles before the time runs out. Players are encouraged to achieve the highest possible score.

The game is based on Google Chrome's famous Dinosaur game, but I added lives and new dynamics to make it a bit more complex and entertaining.

One of the essential requirements was that the game be intuitive, so I decided to have it played using only the space bar, leaving the rest to the player's reflexes.

The game is built using pure JavaScript, without Canvas or external libraries.

The setting is in the Barcelona metro, and I handled all the sprite design, graphics, and animations. I used Paint, Photoshop, and Aseprite to create all the elements. Animations are achieved through CSS's @keyframes property.

The game features a Ranking system that displays the top 5 scores and their respective users. This is accomplished by retrieving data from the SQL database.
