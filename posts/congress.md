# Congress Apps & Websites


Within the company Grupo Pac√≠fico, I have developed countless web pages and applications for its clients. All of them belong to the medicine, pharmaceutical and sports sectors. Each page and application has been consulted by a large audience. On occasions, I have had to travel to organized congresses to be able to observe how attendees interact with the final product.

Some clients have shared needs, others have presented different objectives, therefore, I have had to use different technologies depending on the situation. Within this company I have developed websites, Moodles, webinars, mobile apps and interactive voting.

I highlight the following technologies:

 - React
 - React Native for Mobile apps
 - Wordpress CMS & PHP for file manage on websites.
 - JAVA for interactive voting.
 - MySQL for databases.

Here are some selected works:

#### Websites:

Some of the applications have a section for interactive voting, since in some congresses the participation of the public is necessary.
