This is a self-service app designed for bookstores. Users can select the books they want from the bookstore's catalog and then proceed to place the order at the checkout. Once the payment is completed, the order is recorded in the database. I provide a brief overview of its features in the video *(in Spanish)*.

While many additional features could be incorporated, I've focused on keeping it a small-scale project.

####Technologies used:

- NextJS for both Front-end (React) and Back-end (utilizing SWR and APIs).
- Prisma and MySQL for the Database.
- TailwindCSS for styling.
